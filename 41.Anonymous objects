In this lecture we will learn:
- Object creation in Java
- Anonymous objects in Java
- Difference between Simple objects and Anonymous objects


#1
In JVM, we have both stack memory and heap memory.
- Object is created in the heap memory that contains  variable and methods, it also have some address.
- A obj=new A();
  obj.show();
here, A is the classname.
         obj refers to the address say 101
    show() is a method that is called using reference variable obj.
- Every time you call an object, it will call the constructor as well.
- Object creation can be done in two ways:
 1. Declare an object  - creating a reference
 2. Creating an object  - and assigning the value to it
e,g.,  A obj;
  obj=new A();
 *new A() shows that you are creating an object.
- Reference of an object is created in the stack.


#2
Anonymous Objects:- 
Anonymous objects are simply created by using the new keyword.
- It does not have any reference for an anonymous object.
e.g., new A();
- A method can directly be called using this object.
  new A().show();
- We can't use the same anonymous object again. It will be use only for one time.

// Anonymous objects
class Human{
    int name;

    public Human()
    {
       System.out.println("This is a constructor");
    }

    public void show()
    {
        System.out.println("This is a method");
    }

   
}
public class Codes {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
    new Human().show(); // we dont need to declare object first and then to be called the method
   
   }
    
}
