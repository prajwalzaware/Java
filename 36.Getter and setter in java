In this lecture we will learn:
Setters and getters in Java
- What are setters?
- What are getters?
- 
Shortcut for writing getters and setters in Eclipse:-

- The name of a method should define the objective of the model.
- For every variable, we have two things: Setters and Getters methods inside a class in Java programming. 
- Getter and Setter are methods used to protect your data and make your code more secure.
- Getter and Setter make the programmer convenient in setting and getting the value for a particular data type.
- In both getter and setter, the first letter of the variable should be capitalised.

Getters:-
- If you want to get the value of a method, we use getters.
= public int getAge();

Setters:-
- To set the value in a method, we use overloading.
= public void setAge()

- There is no complusion that there should be all methods and variables inside the class.

Shortcut for writing getters setters in Eclipse:-
= Right-click on the editor - source action or insert code - Generate getters and setters.

/**
 * oops
 */
class human
{
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public void setname(String s)
    {
        name=s;

    }

    public void setage(int a)
    {
        age=a;
    }

    public String getname()
    {
        return name;
    }

    public int getage()
    {
        return age;
    }
}
public class oops {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        human h1=new human();
        h1.setname("prajwal");
        h1.setage(22);

       System.out.println(h1.getname()+" : "+h1.getage()); 

        
    }
}
