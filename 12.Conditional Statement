-- conditional statement is a statement that can be true or false.
-- suppose if ask student is pass. (answer yes or no)
-- this type of statement of statement is conditional statement.

#2
In this part we are only discussing about if-else and 
in next lecture we are discussing if-else-if ladder, ternary operator and switch statement.

#3
syntax of if-else

-- condition is either true or false after evaluation 
-- remember like c and c++, we cannot use number directly as condition of if-else
- if(5) -- not allowed in java 
-- you get Type mismatch: cannot convert from int to boolean
if(condition) 
{
    //code 
    //either this part execute 
}

else
{
    //code
    //or this part execute
}

#4
example:
if want to check a given number is even or odd then;
int num=13;
if(num%2==0)
System.out.println("Even"); //here we not use  braces for single statement {}

else
System.out.println("Odd");  // here we not use braces {}

Note: for single statement braces is not required  but for multiple statement it is required.


#1
-- if-else-if ladder is a series of if, else if or else statements that are executed based on the boolean condition.
-- if else if ladder is used to test multiple conditions

#2
syntax of if-else-if ladder

if(condition1)
{
    //block of code  
}
else if(condition2){
    //block of code
}
else if(condition3)
{
    //block of code
}
else{
    //block of code
}

Note: only one block is executed from all. If all condition is false then else part executed

#3
-- check greatest number from three number.
      int x=8;
      int y=7;
      int z=6; 
        if(x y && x z)
        System.out.println("x is greater");
        else if(y z) 
        System.out.println("y is greater");
        else
        System.out.println("z is greater");
