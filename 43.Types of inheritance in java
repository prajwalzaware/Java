In this lecture we will learn:
- Types of inheritance in Java
- Single inheritance in Java
- Multilevel inheritance in Java
- Examples related to single and multilevel inheritance


Single Inheritance:-
- In single inheritance, subclasses inherit the features of one superclass. 
- Only one parent class exists in single inheritance.
- It is when there are only two classes.
e.g., 
Calc class inherits the properties of AdvCalc class.
Here, Calc - child class
     AdvCalc - parent class


Multi-level inheritance:-
- In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class, and as well as the derived class also acts as the base class for other classes.
- More than one parent class exists in multilevel inheritance.
- It is when we have multiple layers in between the classes.
e.g.,
Calc class inherits the properties of AdvCalc and further AdvCalc inherits the properties of VeryAdvCalc.
Here, Calc - child class
     AdvCalc - parent class of Calc & child class of VeryAdvCalc
     VeryAdvCalc - parent class of both other classes


In this lecture we are discussing:
1)what is multiple inheritance?
2)Why Java does not support Multiple Inheritance?
3)What is ambiguity and not allowed in java?

#1
Multiple inheritance
If a particular class inheriting multiple class then this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritance.
like c++ language there are multiple inheritance like that :
class A
{ 
... .. ... 
};
class B
{
... .. ...
};
class C: public A,public B
{
... ... ...
}; 

But Java not allowed  we have alternate option for that is implementing multiple interface not we will discussing in upcoming lecture.
#2
why java not support multiple inheritance?
=Because of the Ambiguity problem, Java does not support multiple inheritances directly.

#3
Why it is ambiguous?
suppose we have some class A, B and c
class A
{ 
... .. ... 
show(){

}
};
class B
{
... .. ...
show(){

}
};
class  C extends A,B //assume for some instance java support multiple inheritence
{
... ... ...
show(); 
//here we get ambiguity since if we allowed multiple inheritance and same two property or method belong to class A and Class B 
//then how C class use show() method there is ambiguity of choice...
//thatâ€™s why java exclude the concept of multiple inheritance

};
