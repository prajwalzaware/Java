#1
- When you create an object then in the heap memory, it will just create a blank object.
- If you do not assign values than the default values will be assigned like:
 0 for int,
 NULL for string
- We can also define values at the time of the creation of an object by giving our default values.

#2
Properties of a constructor:
- Constructor is almost similar to a method it has a name and it also has round brackets.
- The change in the constructor with respect to the method is that in the constructor we do not specify the return type.
- The name of a constructor must be the same as the class name.
- There is no need to call a constructor. It gets called automatically at the time of the creation of an object.
-  At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
- Constructors are called only once at the time of object creation. While method(s) can be called any number of times.

Syntax of a constructor:
class human {
 public Human()
 {
  statements;
 }
}


A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. 

Parameterized Constructor:-
- A constructor that takes some parameters is known as parameterized constructor.
- The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to different objects.

Default Constructor:-
- A normal constructor is known as the default constructor.
- If you do not create any constructor, then java creates a default constructor. That constructor will be blank with no parameters.
- The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.

- The default constructor can change into the parameterized constructor. But Parameterized constructor canâ€™t change into the default constructor.
