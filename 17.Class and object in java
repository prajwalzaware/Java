- Java is an object-oriented language
- What are objects?
- What are classes?
- How do classes and objects create?

#1
Java is Object- Oriented Programming:-
- In the real world, everything is an object like a pen, mouse, glass, etc.
- Every object has two things:
  - An object knows something ( It has some properties)
 - An object does something( It has a behaviour)
- Every object has a property and behaviour. It can also have multiple properties as well as multiple behaviours.
- To create an object, first, we need to create a class.
- Class act as a blueprint that contains the designing of an object.

#2
- JVM creates objects in Java.
- JVM creates an object but it requires a blueprint.

- Thus, you create a class file that class file gets compiled to create a byte code and that byte code goes to the JVM and then JVM creates an object.

#1
Whatever we do in Java, we do it in a class.
A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
- In a class, we have methods and variables.
- Class will be created in the same java file.
- We can create any number of classes in a program.
- Class does not occupy memory.
Syntax of a class:-
 class classname
 {
  methods, variables
 }

#2
- Every object has two things: properties and methods.
- When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. 
- Action will be done with the help of methods.
- We need to specify the access to methods. We will specify it as public if we want it to be called from anywhere else.
- If we want the method to return any value then we need to specify its return type like int for Integer type values.
- As Java is a statically typed language so you have to specify the return type in it.

Syntax of method:-
= access modifier return type method name()
 public int add()
 {
  statement;
 }

#3
- We need an object to call a method from a different class.
- Creating an object:-
 classname reference variable= new classname();
- reference variable is used to tell that this variable is made to establish a reference between a class.
- new keyword is used to tell that we have to utilise the space for an object.

- We can call a method by using the reference variable of the object. 
- We have to pass the values if we want some operations to be on them.
- We also have to accept values in a method as well if we pass some values. For this, we have to specify parameters in a method based on the type of passed values.
